I work at the intersection of data science and health as an Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I develop computational methods using statistics and machine learning for the analysis of single-cell and spatial genomic and imagine data. In 2024, I co-founded the JHU Genomic Data Science Working Group and today I help co-organize events! I work to made these spaces more welcoming, diverse, and inclusive. üå±"
