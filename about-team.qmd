[**Kasper Hansen**](https://www.hansenlab.org) | I work on Genomic Data Science. My lab develops computational methods for analysis of high-throughput genomic data including transcriptomics and epigenomics measured using bulk, single-cell and spatial technologies. I have developed a number of very widely used software packages primarily released through the Bioconductor project. I am an associate professor of Biostatistics, Biomedical Engineering and Genetic Medicine.

[**Stephanie Hicks**](https://www.stephaniehicks.com) | Hello! I work at the intersection of data science and health as an Associate Professor of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I develop computational methods using statistics and machine learning for the analysis of single-cell and spatial genomic and imagine data. In 2024, I co-founded the JHU Genomic Data Science Working Group and today I help co-organize events! I work to made these spaces more welcoming, diverse, and inclusive. ðŸŒ±

[**IngoÂ Ruczinski**](https://biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/) | My professional expertise is in statistical genetics, genomics and proteomics. I have developed or co-developed several methodologies and open source software packages relevant for genomic array pre-processing, SNP association studies, population and family-based sequencing studies, studies of DNA copy number variants, and proteomic analyses, including data from PhIP-Seq and MIPSA experiments. I collaborate on several large-scale genomic association and sequencing studies at Johns Hopkins and as part of larger collaborations including the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program.
